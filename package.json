  "description": "DirWatcher is a Node.js application designed to monitor changes within a specified directory and expose the results of these changes via a REST API. The application continuously runs as a long-running background process, periodically checking the directory for any modifications, additions, or deletions of files. The results of these checks are made available through a RESTful interface, allowing external systems to query the current state of the directory.",
